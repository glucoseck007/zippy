# Trip Progress Provider Separation

## Summary
Successfully removed all trip progress handling logic from `robot_provider.dart` and ensured that **only** `trip_progress_provider.dart` handles the `robot/+/trip` MQTT topic.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed from robot_provider.dart
- **Method removed**: `updateRobotTripProgress()` - This method was updating robot status and display info based on trip progress, but this functionality is now handled separately by the trip progress provider.
- **Logic preserved**: The robot provider still correctly identifies and ignores trip messages in its MQTT handler, forwarding responsibility to the trip progress provider.

### 2. Updated mqtt_payload_handler.dart  
- **Removed call**: No longer calls `robotProvider.updateRobotTripProgress()` when processing `robot/+/trip` messages.
- **Preserved functionality**: Still generates trip progress notifications and persists trip data, but doesn't update robot provider state.

### 3. Responsibility Separation
- **robot_provider**: Handles robot location, battery, status, and container updates. Explicitly ignores trip progress messages.
- **trip_progress_provider**: Exclusively handles `robot/+/trip` messages with status-based phase logic and progress tracking.

## Technical Details

### Robot Provider MQTT Handling
The robot provider's `_handleRobotStatusUpdate()` method now has this logic for trip messages:
```dart
} else if (topic.contains('/trip')) {
  // Topic: robot/+/trip - Let trip_progress_provider handle this
  print('RobotProvider: Message type: trip_progress - forwarding to trip_progress_provider');
  // Don't handle trip progress here, let trip_progress_provider handle it
}
```

### MQTT Payload Handler Changes
Removed the robot provider update call:
```dart
// REMOVED: This call that was updating robot status based on trip progress
_providerContainer!
    .read(robotProvider.notifier)
    .updateRobotTripProgress(
      robotId: robotId,
      tripCode: tripId,
      progress: progress is double ? progress : progress.toDouble(),
      payload: enhancedPayload,
    );
```

## Benefits

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each provider has a single, well-defined responsibility.
2. **No Duplicate Processing**: Trip progress data is only processed once, by the dedicated trip progress provider.
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to trip progress logic only affect the trip progress provider.
4. **Status-Based Logic**: Trip progress provider uses the new status-based phase determination logic.

## Verification

- ✅ Code compiles successfully with no errors
- ✅ Flutter analyze passes (only warnings/info messages, no errors)
- ✅ Robot provider no longer processes trip messages
- ✅ Trip progress provider exclusively handles `robot/+/trip` topic
- ✅ MQTT routing correctly forwards trip messages to trip progress provider

## Impact

- **Users**: No change in functionality - trip progress still works as expected
- **Developers**: Cleaner code architecture with clear provider boundaries
- **Maintenance**: Easier to modify trip progress logic without affecting robot management
